  Goal: Make spheres moving, bouncing and colliding on the
        surface of a planet. I will also try this new shining
        thing called Entity Component System (ECS). The main
        goal is in fact to learn Rust.

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
What I did so far:
  - a trivial way of recording (what I'm calling)
    functional components using a HasMap
  - a trivial manager for the entities
  - trivial 3D vector (no operations yet)
  - make generic the functional table
  - textual log display using Rust log system
    (to be completed for the new functions)

What's next:
  - velocity (with no acceleration)
  - gravity force and acceleration integration
  - the planet definition
  - detect collision with the planet and reaction
  - create a library for the ECS
  - graphical display
  - render a plain circle
  - try multi-thread processing

 -------------------------------------------------------------

TODO introduce things
OK let's try defining an entity component system (ECS).
See:
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system
  - TODO retrouver un bon tuto/article

The components will we stored in tables a little bit like in
relational database.
We will distinguish two kind of components:
  - "functional component" when there is a 0..1 relation between an entity
    and its component.
  - "relational component" when there is any number of component (of
    a certain kind) associated to one entity.
